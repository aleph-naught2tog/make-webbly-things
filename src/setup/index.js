/**
 * The "browser based web editor" setup script. This script:
 *
 * - will run npm install to make sure the code can run,
 * - checks whether or not you have docker, caddy, and sqlite3 installed
 * - If you don't, it'll do nothing and tell you to install them.
 * - If you do, it will:
 *   - set up the docker base image that is used for projects,
 *   - set up a Caddyfile for this project that gets used for host routing, and
 *   - set up the database that the code relies on for housing user/project/etc data.
 *   - set up an .env file that holds all the various environment variables needed
